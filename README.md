# GradConnect
A web application designed from the ground up by a team of 7 as part of a third year university integrated project.

# The Project Scope
The goal of the project was to create a central platform for recruiters to communicate with students. Students would be able to build up a profile, automatically construct CV's, and have access to resources that allowed them to build their skills. Recruiters would be able to search and view these profiles, as well as post job descriptions for us to handle and return potential candidates.

# The Context
This project was created as part of a 3rd year university integrated project. This unit involved thinking of a fresh idea, building upon this idea as a group, and work towards presenting it as a prototype, or business plan. As a group we were able to execute both outcomes, having a completed business plan, a full design of the system, as well as a functional prototype of the main student features within the 12 weeks we were assigned.
